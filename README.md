Description
Markdown is awesome! All your README.md are made in Markdown, but do you know how GitHub are rendering them?

It’s time to code a Markdown to HTML!

Requirements
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7 or higher)
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
All your files must be executable
All your modules should be documented: python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'
Your code should not be executed when imported (by using if __name__ == "__main__":)
